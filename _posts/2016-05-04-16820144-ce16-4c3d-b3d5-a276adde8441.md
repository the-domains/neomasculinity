Been really pondering starting my own business. I'm tired slaving away for the "man". The harder I work the more I am punished. I see laziness rewarded everyday. The frustrations are building. I have to keep my mouth shut in order to remain employed and pay the bills. The first objective is to break the American consumer debt cycle. Once out of debt I can make my dollars work for me. Until then I must pay off bad money choices. If I consume it I must pay for it, not charge it.
