Spring is here... maybe. The weather is teasing. Warm today then blizzard tomorrow. I went outside to find the owl nest yesterday. It lives in our yard. It appears every morning and evening in our cedar tree. The first time I saw him was about 5 am and he dive bombed my head as I walked to my truck in the twilight. I was startled, but very inspired by the grace and speed in which it glided with. ![](http://i0.wp.com/frametoframe.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Great-Grey-Owl-looks-towards-me-Ottawa-Ontario-Canada-Frame-To-Frame-Bob-Jean-picture.jpg?resize=627%2C418)
