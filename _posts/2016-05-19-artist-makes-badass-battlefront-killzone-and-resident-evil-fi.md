description: "Snow Corporation is a British artist who, inspired by stuff like Sideshow's efforts, builds and modifies custom action figures. Star Wars, Warhammer, Marvel, commissions, he's done it all, and they are all incredible. Note this is different to the VTS figures we showed last week; those are commercial bootlegs, while these are either for commission or personal work."
