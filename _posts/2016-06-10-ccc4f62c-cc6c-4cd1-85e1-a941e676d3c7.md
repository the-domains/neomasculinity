We spent the holliday weekend in the national forrest. I have never NOT camped in a campsite before. It was awesome. As the weekend progressed, what was wilderness, turned into a makeshift city. The quiet tranquility slowly gave way to the steady hum of atvs and side by sides. Family clans of circled campers sprouted up along the trails. Even though the random campers may not have known eathother, each person cordially greeted all passing wilderness wanderers with the same enthusiasm as if greeting long lost friends. The sense of freedom was a tangible commodity as Confederate and Gadsen flags hung from awnings and billowed behind ATVs and 4x4s. It was a refreshing weekend full of hiking, swimming and fireside fun. Open fire cooking is the best. Smoked avocado nachos? I think yes!
