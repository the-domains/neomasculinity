description: 'My day has been plagued by thing I think I should have already known but didn’t. Knowledge, ideals, and attitudes that are important to the life of a man should be found by guidance over trial and error. Don’t get me wrong, every man will learn by mistakes over his lifetime, but not everything should have to come so hard. I’m thankfull for the fatherly figure I have found later in life. I hope to be able to be a good masculine influence to my own boys. The Internet is not a good dad, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. I work constantly to improve my knowledge and skill sets to be able to pass on guidance and advice to my boys. I will break the cycle of brokenness.'

My day has been plagued by thing I think I should have already known but didn't. Knowledge, ideals, and attitudes that are important to the life of a man should be found by guidance over trial and error. Don't get me wrong, every man will learn by mistakes over his lifetime, but not everything should have to come so hard. I'm thankfull for the fatherly figure I have found later in life. I hope to be able to be a good masculine influence to my own boys. The Internet is not a good dad, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. I work constantly to improve my knowledge and skill sets to be able to pass on guidance and advice to my boys. I will break the cycle of brokenness.

_I will learn to be a father._
